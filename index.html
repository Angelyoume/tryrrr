         <span>Based Shibalnu re-launching is live</span> 
           
          Weâ€™re indeed very sorry for the long hold by our team, Weâ€™ve decided to migrate from our old contract to new old and this is decision by our team
          Due to some recent set backs faced by the devs on this project we will be migrating to v2 to enhance better performance of the tokens 
          
          We have taken a snapshot of all current holders and now everyone can migrate to our new contract  from the portal with migration ratio 1:1 
           
          The migration from V1 to V2 happens seamlessly within a single transaction. The transaction process takes approximately 30 seconds and will be completed with a simple gas fee that is not inflated by the number of tokens you are migrating.
          
          We will offer support through this process and insure that the Migration can happen at any point in the future. Here is how simple it is to migrate V1 to V2.
          
          Thank you for your patience and understanding during this challenging time, we remain dedicated to building a secure and prosperous future for our Great community
